# Solidity Course
In this course I was learnt about Blockchain (which is certainly a WEB3) along with the solidity programming. There are so many concepts of solidity I learnt from this course like as
1.Variables
2.Datatypes
3.Mapping
4.Functions etc,
At last after complete this course i have a project to mint and burn a token with the help of solidity.

## Overview

In this challenge I have to created contract name as MyToken give a string named "note" abbreviated as "coin" along with the record of its total supply (Initially set a zero). 
To run this mint and burn function i have to create a function of those!!
For mint , I put a certain value to mint it will increase the totalsupply and balance as well. (In this I used 524)
For Burn , I put a certain value to Burn it will decrease the totalsupply and balance as well. (In this I  used 124)

### Series of Steps

* I used the Online Remix IDE for writing the solidity code Program with a version (pragma solidity 0.8.18).
* Then I created a file named as shr.sol for publishing that same code on GitHub.

### Compilation 

* If you are using The Remix IDE (Online) then you simply compile the code from the side menu given at the left side.
* After compiling the code , you have to deploy the Contract from side menu given at the left side.
* After deploying the code , you have to enter inputs according to requirement of mint and burn functions of the contract. 

## General Feel

I was new in this technology when I started to learn . The Footpath are properly designed to create over Surrounding . Experience was good and I would like to do another courses also.
